# Mohr-Coulomb
Thanks to the matlab script created by Jon Kortram (PhD at TU Delft) I was able to create this translated version to python. 
If you do laboratory tests, such as UCS or Triaxial, and you are able to obtain the Max Stress before failure or the Yield Points from those experiments
(depending on what you want to predict), this code might be of help.

This repository includes the csv files with data of the tests if you want to obtain yourself different data.
The samples were tested at different confining pressures each cycle, you can see the Repository 'Modulii' in order to see the raw data plotted.
